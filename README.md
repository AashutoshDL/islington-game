### âœ… Rules:
- `0.0.X`: 
  - The patch version (X) ranges from `0` to `9`.
  - Used to mark small feature iterations, fixes, or experiments.
  - After `0.0.9`, the version should increment to `0.1.0`.

- `Sensible_Name`: 
  - A short, descriptive name using hyphens or underscores (no spaces).
  - Represents the purpose of the branch (e.g., `ui-update`, `game-ui-popup`, `loading-refactor`).
